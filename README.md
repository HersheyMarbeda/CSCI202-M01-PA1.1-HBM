## Programming Assignment
This assignment involves creating a program that converts Roman numerals to decimal numbers using a class named romanType. The class should store a Roman numeral, convert it to its decimal equivalent, and provide methods to print the numeral in both formats. Key Roman numeral values include M (1000), D (500), C (100), L (50), X (10), V (5), and I (1), with rules for addition and subtraction based on numeral placement. Additionally, the program should be tested using the Roman numerals "MCXIV", "CCCLIX", and "MDCLXVI".
